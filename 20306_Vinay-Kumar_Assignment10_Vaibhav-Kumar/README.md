README
There are two py file and one jupyter notebook file.
two py files named as divider_idx.py and tiff to patches. with the help of these two files i converted large tiff images to patches saved in a respective folder. you have to give the path of tiff image and destination to produce the patche sof the given which is mentioned in the code.
This Jupyter Notebook contains a project that uses machine learning techniques to classify strawberry farms based on their visual characteristics using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Project Description
The project aims to classify different strawberry farms based on their visual features such as size, shape, and color using a CNN model. The dataset used in this project contains images of different strawberry farms captured using a drone. The images are preprocessed to improve the quality of the dataset, and then the CNN model is trained on this dataset to classify the farms into different categories.
Installation
To run this Jupyter Notebook, you will need to install the following packages:
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip or conda:
Usage
To use this Jupyter Notebook, you can simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells in sequence. The notebook is designed to guide you through the entire process from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
You will need to download the dataset, which is provided in the form of a ZIP file. Extract the ZIP file to a local directory and update the file path in the notebook to point to the extracted directory.
Conclusion
The proposed CNN-based classification model can be used for accurate and efficient classification of strawberry farms, which can help farmers in decision-making and yield optimization.
